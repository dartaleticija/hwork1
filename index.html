        Machu Picchu, also spelled <i>Machupijchu</i>, site of ancient Inca
        ruins located about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Cuzco, Peru, in the
        Cordillera de Vilcabamba of the Andes Mountains. It is perched above the
        Urubamba River valley in a narrow saddle between two sharp peaks—Machu
        Picchu (“Old Peak”) and Huayna Picchu (“New Peak”)—at an elevation of
        7,710 feet (2,350 metres). One of the few major pre-Columbian ruins
        found nearly intact, Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage
        site in 1983.

          <td>High start</td>
          <td>
            This route leads from the entrance through the upper sector, over
            agricultural terraces, past the guard's house, through the main
            entrance to the urban sector, to the sun temple, and from there over
            the water mirrors in the lower sector back to the exit.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="color: darkblue">Route 2, dark blue</td>
          <td>High long</td>
          <td>
            This is the most comprehensive route and is the most complete
            exploration of the citadel. The route leads from the entrance
            through the upper sector, over agricultural terraces, past the
            guard's house, through the main entrance into the urban sector, to
            the temple of the sun. From there it continues over the temple
            square and the Intiwatana Pyramid in the upper sector to the sacred
            rock in the rearmost part of the citadel, and then through the lower
            sector past the condor temple to the exit.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="color: rgb(255, 238, 0)">Route 3, yellow</td>
          <td>Low short</td>
          <td>
            This is the shortest of all routes and includes only a small,
            limited part of the citadel. The route leads over agricultural
            terraces directly into the lower sector, past the Temple of the Sun,
            to the house of the Inca, and from there over the water mirrors in
            the lower sector back to the exit. This route only requires you to
            navigate a few stairs and is particularly suitable for people with
            reduced mobility.
